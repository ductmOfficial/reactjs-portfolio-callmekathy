  It's just some guy I work with.
  Come on. You're going out with the guy.
  There's got to be something wrong with him.
  So, does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?
  Wait, does he eat chalk?
  Just 'cause I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl.
  Okay, everybody relax. This is not a date.
  It's two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
  Sounds like a date to me.
  So I'm back in high school. I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria
  And I realize I am totally... naked.
  I've had that dream.
  Then, I look down and I realize there is a phone...
  There.
  Instead of..? That's right.
  Never had that dream.
  All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring
  And it turns out it's my mother
  Which is very, very weird because...
  She never calls me.
  Hi.
  This guy says "hello. I want to kill myself."
  Are you okay, sweetie?
  I feel like someone reached down my throat
  Grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out my mouth
  And tied it around my neck. cookies?
  Carol moved her stuff out today.
  Let me get you some coffee.
  No. oh, no. no, don't. stop cleansing my aura.
  Leave my aura alone, okay?
  I'll be fine, all right? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. monica: no, you don't.
  No, I don't. to hell with her.
  She left me.
  And you never knew she was a lesbian?
  No. okay?
  Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
  She didn't know. How should I know?
  Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
  Did I say that out loud?
  All right, Ross, look
  You're feeling a lot of pain right now.
  You're angry. you're hurting.
  Can I tell you what the answer is?
  Strip joints!
  Oh, come on. you're single.
  See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
  I just, I just, I just want to be married again.
  And I just want a million dollars.
  Rachel?
  Oh, god, Monica, hi. Thank god.
  I just went to your building and you weren't there
  And then this guy with a big hammer
  Said that you might be here, and you are.
  Can I get you some coffee? decaf.
  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel
  Another Lincoln High survivor.
  This is everybody. this is Chandler and Phoebe, and Joey
  And you remember my brother Ross?
  Sure.
  Hi. oh!
  So, you want to tell us now
  Or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
  Oh, god. well, it started
  About a half hour before the wedding.
  I was in this room where we were keeping all the presents
  And I was looking at this gravy boat-- this really gorgeous limoges gravy boat--
  When all of a sudden...
  Sweet and low?
  I realized that I was more turned on
  by this gravy boat than by barry
  And then I got really freaked out and that's when it hit me
  How much Barry looks like mr. potato head.
  I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...
  Anyway, i just had to get out of there
  And I started wondering, "why am I doing this
  And who am I doing this for?"
  So, anyway, I just didn't know where to go
  And I know that you and I have drifted apart
  But you're the only person I knew who lived in the city.
  Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
  Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
  Monica: now, I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ
  And she's really not happy about it.
  Daddy, I just...
  I can't marry him.
  I'm sorry.
  I just don't love him.
  Well, it matters to me.
  Chandler: She should not be wearing those pants.
  I say push her down the stairs.
  All: push her down the stairs! push her down
  The stairs!
  All right!
  Come on, daddy, listen to me.
  All of my life
  Everyone has always told me, "you're a shoe.
  You're a shoe. you're a shoe."
  And then today i just stopped and said
  "What if I don't want to be a shoe? "What if I want to be a purse?
  Or a hat?"
  No, I don't want you to buy me a hat. I'm saying that I am a hat...
  It's a metaphor, daddy!
  You can see where he'd have trouble.
  Look, daddy, it's my life.
  Well, maybe I'll just stay here with monica.
  Well, I guess we've established she's staying here with Monica.
  Well, maybe that's my decision.
  Well, maybe I don't need your money.
  Wait, wait! I said maybe!
  Okay, just breathe. that's it.
  Just try to think of nice, calm things.
  I'm all better now.
  I helped.
  Okay, look, this is probably for the best.
  Independence... taking control of your life.
  And hey, you need anything you can always come to Joey.
  Me and Chandler live right across the hall
  Stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.
  Like there's a rule or something?
  Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.
  Uh, it's-- it's paul.
  Buzz him in.
  Who's Paul?
  "Paul the wine guy" paul? maybe.
  Your "not a real date" tonight
  Is it with "Paul the wine guy"?
  He finally asked you out? yes.
  A "dear diary" moment.
  Rach, wait. I can cancel.
  Please, no, go. I'll be fine.
  Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
  That would be good.
  No! Go on!
  It's "Paul the wine guy!"
  Hi. come in.
  Paul, this is...
  Everybody, this is paul.
  All: "Paul the wine guy!"
  I didn't catch your name.
  Paul, was it?
  Sit down. Two seconds.
  I just pulled out four eyelashes. that can't be good.
  So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
  I was kind of supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.
  So, nothing.
  Right. you're not even getting your honeymoon.
  God...
  No... aruba.
  This time of year, talk about your...
  Big lizards.
  Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight
  Joey and Chandler are helping me put together
  My new furniture.
  And we're very excited about it.
  Thanks, but I'm going to hang out here tonight.
  It's been a long day. oh, sure. Okay, sure.
  Pheebs, you want to help? I wish I could, but I don't want to.
  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things
  Using a bunch of these little worm guys.
  I have no brackety things. I see no worm guys whatsoever.
  And I cannot feel my legs.
  What's this?
  I have no idea.
  Done with the bookcase! all finished!
  This was Carol's favorite beer.
  She always drank it out of the can.
  I should have known.
  Ross, let me ask you a question.
  She got the furniture, the stereo, and the good tv.
  What did you get?
  You guys.
  You got screwed. oh, my god.
  Oh, my god. I know. I'm such an idiot.
  I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist
  Four and five times a week.
  I mean, how clean can teeth get?
  My brother's going through that now. He's such a mess.
  How did you get through it?
  He might try accidentally breaking
  Something valuable of hers-- say, her...
  Leg?
  That's one way of going through it.
  I went for the watch.
  You actually broke her watch?
  Barry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
  I know you probably think this is all about what I said the other night
  About you making love with your socks on but it isn't.
  It isn't-- it's about me.
  Hi. The machine cut me off again. anyway...
  You know what the scariest part is?
  What if there's only one woman for everybody?
  What if you get one woman and that's it?
  Unfortunately, in my case there was only one woman for her.
  What are you talking about?
  That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
  Let me tell you something, ross. there's lot of flavors out there.
  There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
  You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
  This is the best thing that ever happened to you.
  You got married.
  You were like, what, eight?
  Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
  I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
  Then stay out of my freezer.
  Ever since she walked out on me, i...
  What?
  What, you want to spell it out with noodles?
  No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
  Oh, so, there's going to be a fifth date?
  Isn't there?
  Yeah, yeah, I think there is.
  What were you going to say?
  Well, well...
  Ever since she left me, um...
  I haven't been able to perform...
  Sexually.
  Oh, god. I'm so sorry.
  It's okay.
  Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
  How long?
  Two years.
  Wow.
  I-i-i'm glad you smashed her watch.
  So, you still think you, um...
  Might want that fifth date?
  Yeah.
  Yeah, i do.
  I, Joanie, take Charles as my lawful husband.
  Do you take joanie...
  See, but joanie loves chachi.
  That's the difference.
  Grab a spoon.
  Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
  Do the words "Billy, don't be a hero" mean anything to you?
  You know, here's the thing.
  Even if i could get it together enough to ask a woman out
  Who am I going to ask?
  Isn't this amazing?
  I have never made coffee in my entire life.
  That is amazing. congratulations.
  While you're on a roll,
  If you feel like you got to make a western omelet or something...
  Actually, I'm really not that hungry this morning.
  Morning.
  Morning. morning.
  Morning. Morning, paul.
  Hello, paul.
  Hi. paul, is it?
  I had a great time last night.
  Thank you so much.
  We'll talk later. yeah.
  Thank you.
  That wasn't a real date.
  What the hell do you do on a real date?
  Shut up and put my table back.
  Joey: okay.
  All right, kids, I got to get to work.
  If I don't input those numbers...
  It doesn't make much of a difference.
  So, like, you guys all have jobs?
  Yeah, we all have jobs.
  See, that's how we buy stuff.
  Yeah. i'm an actor.
  Have I seen you in anything?
  I doubt it. mostly regional work.
  Unless you caught the wee ones' production of pinocchio.
  "Look, gepetto, I'm a real live boy."
  I will not take this abuse.
  I'm sorry.
  ♪ Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy. ♪
  So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
  Did you talk to barry? I can't stop smiling.
  I can see that. you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
  I know. he's just so...
  You remember you and tony demarco? oh, yeah.
  Well, it's like that-- with feelings.
  Oh, wow, are you in trouble?
  I am just going to get up, go to work
  And not think about him all day.
  Or else I'm just going to get up and go to work.
  Wish me luck. what for?
  I'm going to get
  One of those job things.
  Hey, monica. frannie, welcome back.
  How was florida?
  You had sex, didn't you?
  How do you do that?
  So, who?
  You know paul?
  Paul, the wine guy?
  Oh, yeah, I know paul.
  You mean, you know Paul like I know paul?
  Are you kidding? I take credit for paul.
  You know, before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
  Of course it was a line.
  Why would anybody do something like that?!
  I assume we're looking for an answer
  More sophisticated than "to get you into bed."
  Is it me?!
  Is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs
  And men with severe emotional problems can hear?
  Give me your feet.
  I just thought he was nice, you know?
  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
  Guess what? you got a job?
  Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.
  I was laughed out of 12 interviews.
  Yet you're upbeat.
  You would be, too, if you found joan and david boots on sale
  50 percent off.
  Oh, how well you know me.
  They're my new i-don't-need-a-job,
  I-don't-need-my-parents, i've-got-great-boots boots.
  How did you pay for them?
  A credit card.
  And who pays for that?
  Um... my father.
  Come on. you can't live off your parents your whole life.
  I know that. That's why I was getting married.
  It's hard being on your own the first time.
  Thank you.
  I remember when I first came here.
  I was 14, my mom had just killed herself
  And my stepdad was back in prison.
  I got here and didn't know anybody.
  I ended up living with this albino guy
  Who was cleaning windshields outside port authority
  And then I found aroma therapy.
  So I know exactly how you feel.
  The word you're looking for is...
  "anyway..."
  All right. Are you ready?
  I don't think so.
  Cut. cut.
  ( chanting ): cut. cut. cut. cut. cut.
  ( cheering )
  Welcome to the real world. It sucks.
  You're going to love it.
  That's it.
  You want to crash on the couch? no. I got to go home.
  Are you going to be okay?
  Yeah.
  Hey, mon, look what I found.
  What?
  That's Paul's watch.
  Put it back where you found it.
  Oh, boy.
  All right, good night, everybody.
  Both: good night.
  Oh, sorry.
  Oh, no. go.
  Okay.
  Thanks.
  You probably didn't know this but back in high school I had a...
  Major crush on you.
  I knew.
  You did?
  I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
  I did.
  Listen, do you think--
  And try not to let my intense vulnerability
  Become any kind of a factor here--
  But would it be okay if i asked you out sometime maybe?
  Yeah.
  Maybe.
  Okay.
  Okay, maybe i will.
  Good night.
  See you.
  Wait, wait.
  What's with you?
  I just grabbed a spoon.
  I can't believe what I'm hearing.
  ♪ I can't believe what I'm hearing. ♪
  I said you had...
  ♪ I said you had... ♪
  Would you stop?
  Was I doing it again?
  All: yes!
  Would anybody like more coffee?
  Did you make it or are you just serving it?
  I'm just serving it.
  Yeah. yeah. yeah.
  Kids, new dream.
  I'm in las vegas.
  I'm liza minnelli.
